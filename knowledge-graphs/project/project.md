# Project
This project is supposed to pull together the cumulative experience obtained through the rest of the Drawbridge curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
1. Exercise all aspects of the ontology engineering paradigm from a practical perspective.

## Assignment Summary
* Identify from the Ohio-KG repository on `arsenal.cs.wright.edu` what datasets have already been materialized.
* Choose a dataset to add. There are many repositories of data. The requirement for this assignment is that it must pertain to Ohio. Check the References section for possible data sources.
* Create a set of _key notions_ and _competency questions_ for the new data set and how it is incorporated into the Ohio-KG.
* Follow the Modular Ontology Modeling methodology to produce an ontology for that dataset, as informed by the _key notions_ and _competency questions_.
* Use `kastle-foundry` to produce a materialized graph according to the dataset and produced ontology file.
* Execute SPARQL queries corresponding to the _competency questions_.
* Place all necessary documentation into a `.md` file.

## Deliverables
* **Schema Diagram --** use yEd and the KASTLE syntax.
* **Ontology (`.owl` file) --** use Protégé or CoModIDE to produce an ontology. 
* **Materialized Graph (`.ttl` file) --** use KASTLE Foundry to produce a materialized graph.
* **Documentation --** place the key notions, competency questions, schema diagram(s), axioms, and SPARQL queries with results into this file.
