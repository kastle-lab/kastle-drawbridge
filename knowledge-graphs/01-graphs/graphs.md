# Graphs

##  Formal Definition 
* A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) and edges.[1]
* Graphs are non-linear because the data structure allows us to have different paths to get from one vertex to another, unlike with linear data structures like Arrays or Linked Lists.[1]

##  Nodes 
* A node, is a point or an object in the Graph[1]

##  Edges 
* An edge is used to connect two vertices with each other.[1]

##  Linked Data 
* A set of best practices for publishing structured data on the Web.[2]
* The set consists of :
1. Use URIs as names for things.
2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information.
4. Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.[2]
