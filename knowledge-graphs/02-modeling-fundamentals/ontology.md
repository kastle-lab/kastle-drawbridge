# Ontology

### Definition

An ontology is a conventional way of representing data within a specific area of thought or domain (e.g., manufacturing, mathematics, biology, etc.). Using an ontology provides an orderly design for knowledge that facilitates clear communication and reasoning. In the context of Knowledge Graphs, ontologies represent the relationships between entities and the entities themselves.

To learn more essential details about the core concepts of an ontology, please check out the [“What is an Ontology”](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/blob/master/curriculum/modules/What_is_an_Ontology/What_is_an_Ontology.md) module from The Knowledge Graphs Conference and Community and any of the other resources below.
