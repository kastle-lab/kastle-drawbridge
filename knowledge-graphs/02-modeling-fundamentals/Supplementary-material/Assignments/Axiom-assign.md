<center> **NOTE**  </center>

1. A relation can have multiple axioms so make sure that what you select makes sense and you can justify your answer to the lab! 
2. Make sure that you went thought the entire  [Understanding Axioms](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EmLxLo8yzo9-O6nKr7Yf6GRZdUXqe_VovG02JbTuh60/edit?usp=sharing) presentation before begining this assignment since this is testing you over <ins>ALL</ins> Axioms not just **KASTLE's** *HOTTEST AXIOMS* ü•µü•µü•µ discussed in the [Axioms module](/knowledge-graphs/02-modeling-fundamentals/Axioms.md). 




Lets look at some relations that need some ‚ú®*Axiomization*‚ú®
