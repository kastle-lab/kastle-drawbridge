# Key Notions

### Definition

`Key notions` can be thought of as the fundamental ideas that establish the purpose of a Knowledge Graph (KG). They can be determined by how many overlaps a concept appears within the competency questions or the high frequency with which a concept relates to other ideas. These core concepts are the foundation and guide for the KG construction process when designing ontological patterns and modules.
