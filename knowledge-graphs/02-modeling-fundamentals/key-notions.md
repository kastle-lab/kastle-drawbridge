# Key Notions

### Definition

`Key notions` can be thought of as the fundamental ideas that establish the purpose of a Knowledge Graph (KG) [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826824000283). They can be determined by how many overlaps a concept appears within the `competency questions`, or the high frequency with which a concept relates to other ideas within each data source [[2]](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler//pub2/2020-mom-tutorial.pdf), [[3]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3233/SW-222886). These core concepts are the foundation and guide for the KG modeling process when designing [ontological](/knowledge-graphs/02-modeling-fundamentals/ontology.md) patterns and `modules` [[1]](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler//pub2/2020-mom-tutorial.pdf).

### Example

As an example, we will explore the example given in section three of the Modular Ontology Modeling: A Tutorial paper [[2]](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler//pub2/2020-mom-tutorial.pdf).

Let's assume we want to build a Knowledge Graph that incorporates recipes from the various popular recipe sites across the Web, and we have established the following `competency questions` for our use case:

```
1. How do I make chili with red beans?
2. What are some sweet breakfast items under 100 calories?
3. What minimal meals can I cook in under 30 minutes?
```

From these questions and the analysis of recipes from data sources, we can likely conceive of the following as `key notions`:

```
- RecipeName
- RecipeInstructions
- FoodType
- QuantityOfFood
- TimeInterval
```

These are just a few potential key notions, but choosing the above makes sense as recipes typically have a name, include instructions for prepping and cooking, define the food type, include serving quantities and the number of ingredients, and have cooking times. From here, further analysis of these `key notions` is required when trying to instate these `key notions` and create `modules`.
