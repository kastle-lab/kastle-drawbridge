# Modeling Fundamentals
## Knowledge Graph
- (Node, Edge, Node)
- Nodes as Entities/Classes/Subjects
- Edge as Relationships/Predicates
- Knowledge Graphs are a `Directed Graph` that associates Class Entities as `Nodes`/`Vertices` and Relationships as `Edges`.

##  Linked Data 
Knowledge Graphs are designed with principles inherited from Linked Data, which is a set of best practices for publishing structured data onto the Web.
* The set consists of :
  1. The use of URIs as names for things.
  2. The use of HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
  3. When someone looks up a URI, the URI must provide useful information.
  4. Inclusion of links to other URIs to provide further insight on the described domain.

## [Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))
- "is a branch of philosophy...as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality."
- _onto-_,from the Greek, "being; that which is"
- _-logia_ "logical discourse"

### Types of Ontology:
- Domain Ontology: representation of concepts from a realm
- Upper Ontology: representation of shared relations and objects generally applicable across a wide range of domains
- Hybrid Ontology: combining Domain and Upper Ontology

## [Axioms](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/pub2/04-axiomatization.pdf)
Axioms are _asserted_ constraints to how a knowledge graph can be constructed. 

Example:
* Person(Cogan), hasFather(Cogan, Bill)
The above example is written in `First Order Predicate Logic`. In the above example, we assert that Cogan is a Person.  It is also asserted that Cogan has a father, and that father is Bill.

### Closed World Assumptions
* Implies that attributes outside the ontology that are not explicitly stated are considered 'False'.

### Open World Assumptions
* Implies that attributes outside the ontology CAN be 'True' (implied).

### Common Axioms and their descriptions
The below illustrates in `Figure 2` common axioms written in Description Logic syntax (discussed in the next section). The numbered list in this depiction describes the axioms in natural language.

![17 axioms](https://github.com/kastle-lab/kastle-drawbridge/assets/70174975/8d3d557f-059a-44cc-a806-068f0222dc5c)

## [Description Logic](https://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/cse/185/)
> "Description logics (DLs) is a family of knowledge representation (KR) languages which represent knowledge in a domain of interest using formal, logic-based semantics through knowledge bases (KBs) containing general assertions of describing relevant concepts - hence, the term description - and specific assertions about individuals and relationships among them." (Krisnadhi, 2014)

Description Logic, as a set of knowledge representation languages, encompasses the formal representation of knowledge with admittances of _truths_ in the world.  

Knowledge can be formally defined with the concepts of TBox and ABox where:
- TBox is a set of axioms constraining terminology definitions (`concepts` or `roles`)
- ABox is a set of axioms constraining  `named individuals` (First-Order Logic(R(a,b))

Additionally, Description Logic includes another concept, RBox where:
- RBox is a set of axioms constraining `roles`

> "A description logic (DL) models `concepts`, `roles` and `individuals`, and `their relationships`." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic)

These asserted admittances are broken down from concept and role constructors:
1. Top and Concept, represented respectively by Tautology(⊤,up tack, falsum, \tee) and Contradiction((⊥, down tack, verum, \bot)
2. nominal
3. Intersection and Union
4. Complements (Negation)
5. Universal Restrictions
6. Existential Restrictions
7. Cardinality Restrictions (at minimum, at maximum, exactly)

### From _ALC_ to _SROIQ_
- _ALC_, or Attributed Language with general Complement, 
  - _ALC_ provides support from the above list with including admittances for 1, 3, 4, and 7, along with `TBox` axioms (axioms constraining concepts), and `ABox` axioms (axioms constraining named individuals).
- _SHIF_ extends from _ALC_ and adds `Role` admittances
- _SHOIN_ adds from _SHIF_ with including #2 and #7
- _SROIQ_ combines all of the above with `RBox` Axioms and extends additional constraints to `Roles` and applies numeric conditions and qualifications for 5, 6, 7.
