# Key Notions
Using the narrative and the competency questions, what are important identifiable classes that support the overall implementation and usage of our KG?

*What are these key notions, how can we use them, and where can we get this information from?*
- The *key notions* for this KG are the **Agent** and **AgentRole**, which can be used to identify characteristics (Name) of an Agent and their hierarchical family relationships (Father, Son, Daughter, etc.) with each other. This information can be found within the kastle-bridge repository, [here](https://github.com/kastle-lab/kastle-drawbridge/blob/cf3582ec0bed897aeb851ddd5853c277ed09573d/knowledge-graphs/family-tree/data/simpsons-family-tree.csv).
