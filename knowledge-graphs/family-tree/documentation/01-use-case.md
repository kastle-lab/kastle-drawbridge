# Narrative
What is the purpose of this KG?  
- This knowledge graph serves the purpose of representing members of the Simpson Family and their family roles. A role is the hierarchal nomenclature given to a family member based on their relationship to one another.
  
What makes it interesting?
- Our knowledge graph will be modularly designed using patterns to facilitate reuse. The patterns drive the reusability by providing a framework with templates to save time on ontology development and provide structure for future ontologists to add to this knowledge graph.
  
What are its uses and applications?
- To identify the relationships between family members.
- To identify the characteristics of each family member.
