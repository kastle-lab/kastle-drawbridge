**Name:** Eric Smith 
**Archetype:** The Eric 
**Status:**  Graduate Research Assistant

</td>

<td style="width:70%; vertical-align:top; padding:10px;">

Eric is a second year Master's student pursuing his thesis in Computer Science. After being in communications with various professors at the Computer Science and Engineering Department he came across professor X which gave him a description about what his Semantic and Knowledge Graph Technologies is all about. Eric had taken an internship at a local research lab where he had to work with other scientists in identifying terms for a dataset containing hardware information. He got familiar with what is a Knowledge Graph and what is an Ontology since he was actively working with identifying entities and relationships of the dataset. He also took Professors X Logic course last semester so he is familiar with Predicate and Description logic along with Manchester Syntax. Professor X explained that an option for this thesis would be expanding on that work he did in his intership  but that we would have to follow the steps the lab usually takes, along with materializing and evaluating the ontology he will end up building.


### Background & Needs

Eric's learning path consists of the whole vizualisation, constructing and validation process. He has to learn all the tools the lab uses when it comes to Knowledge Graph construction and validation.

---

### Learning Path
This persona would benefit from the following learning path:

- What is an Identifier
- Protege
- OWL
- Deploying a Knowledge Graph
- RDF_Serializations
- SPARQL
- SHACL

---

### Outcome
This learning path would provide Eric with the necessary insights that they can use to complete his thesis project.

# THE PASCAL

<table>

<td style="width:30%; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:10px;">

**![Placeholder Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150 "Profile Image")**

**Name:** Pascal Walters
**Archetype:** The Pascal
**Status:** Associate Professor

</td>

<td style="width:70%; vertical-align:top; padding:10px;">

Pascal is an associate professor in the Computer Science department of X university. He recently had a successfull research proposal with three other universities regarding collaborating on an ontology/ and knowledge graph of a specific domain along with a natural language engine that queries it and is interactive. All of the researchers need to settle with a common language they will be using along with what ontology engineering methodology they will use. All of the researchers except Pascal have been using MoMo while he uses BFO. He has to be able to fully comprehend that process while also guiding his students that are part of the grant and will be working on it as well. He needs to go through all the stages of Modular Ontology Modeling along with the tools that are most commonly used. 


### Background & Needs

Pascal's learning path consists of learning how to vizualise the graph through yEd, work on the axioms using Protégé and then materialize it and validate it using SPARQL.



---

### Learning Path
This persona would benefit from the following learning path:

- Protege, yEd\
- OWL Syntax.
- How to deploy a Knowledge Graph.
- What is a TTL file, how to read it ?
- SPARQL query language, when and how to use it ?
- Validation of the KG through Apache Jena Fuseki.


---

### Outcome
This learning path would provide Pascal with the necessary insights to collaborate with the other researchers and to also onboard his students.
