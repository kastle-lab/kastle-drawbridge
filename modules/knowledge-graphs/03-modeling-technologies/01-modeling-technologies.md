# Modeling Technologies

Below are the topics that will be covered within this section of Module 2 Section 3.

## [Competency Questions](../02-modeling-fundamentals/04-Competency-Question.md)

- Evaluation method
  What are CQs? How can they be used? How do CQs connect with the KG's narrative and use-case? How do CQs provide constraints and boundaries to develop within?

## [Schema Diagramming](02-schema-diagrams.md)

How do `Schema Diagrams` help with ontology development?

- [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) tool
  What is yEd? Graphically, does KASTLE have a standard to abide by?

## [Schema Development](./03-protege.md)

- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu)  
  What is Protege? How does a Protege representation differ from the diagram?
  Cogan: "The diagram is half the story (picture), and protege provides the other half of the story" or something along those lines

## [SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)](./04-sparql.md)

`SPARQL` is a database query language that is explicitly used for data stored in the format of Resource Description Framework (RDF).

### [Tutorial](./05-sparql-tutorial.md)

Using the above link will take you to a brief tutorial on how to use a SPARQL query. Refer to [SPARQL topic](./04-sparql.md) for additional concepts on query design and filtering.

### [Querying Methods](./06-querying-methods.md)

This section covers the ways in which SPARQL queries can be used through a web interface or Python code.

## [Materialization](./07-materialization.md)

`Materialization` is the term used to describe the process of applying the axioms from an ontology to a knowledge graph, reasoning over the data, and explicitly populating the graph with triples formed from the raw data.
