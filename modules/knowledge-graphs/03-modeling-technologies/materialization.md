# Materialization

Materialization is the term used to describe the process of applying the axioms from an ontology to a knowledge graph, reasoning over the data, and explicitly adding all new triples that would logically follow. The result is a materialized graph, which can then be queried more efficiently and thoroughly.

Materialization has some benefits and downsides:

### Benefits

- Explicit declaration of inferenced data
- Faster and efficient querying
- More complete results

### Downsides

- Increased storage requirements
- Longer preprocessing times

## Example:

```
# Original Triples

# Infered Triples
```
