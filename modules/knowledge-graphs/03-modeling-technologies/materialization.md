# Materialization

Materialization is the term used to describe the process of applying the axioms from an ontology to a knowledge graph, reasoning over the data, and explicitly populating the graph with triples formed from the raw data. The result is a materialized graph, which can then be queried more efficiently and thoroughly.
This is done using the [RDFLib starter code](../../../resources/rdflib-starter.py).

Keep in mind that materialization has some benefits and downsides:

### Benefits

+: Explicit declaration of inferenced data

+: Faster and efficient querying

+: More complete results

### Downsides

-: Increased storage requirements

-: Longer preprocessing times

## Example:

```
# Original Triples


# Infered Triples
```
