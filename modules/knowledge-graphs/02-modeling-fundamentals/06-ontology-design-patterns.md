# Ontology Design Patterns

## Definition

`Ontology Design Patterns` (ODPs) are small, self-contained ontologies that aim to address general problems in ontology design. They can also be described as a collection of semantic patterns that provide a generic construct for ontology development. An ODP forms a small component or module of a complete ontology. Additionally, they facilitate the reuse of established design patterns, which can be tailored into a more specific module for a use case, streamlining the ontology building process.

## Background

ODPs were introduced by [Gangemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-iVGcoAAAAAJ), [Blomqvist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4ftCkeQAAAAJ), and [Sandkuhl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5MxuPr4AAAAJ) in 2005 to simplify the ontology development process. A primary motivator for the inception of ODPs is to provide ontology engineers with small, reusable OWL ontologies that can be integrated into their larger constituents to solve specific modeling challenges. Since then, pattern-based design has become a state-of-the-art (SOTA) standard practice in ontology engineering, enabling modular design and encouraging the reuse of existing patterns. The reason is that ODPs have been shown to positively impact the quality of developed ontologies and to improve interoperability.

In summary, ODPs emerged as a critical tool for standardizing, simplifying, and improving the quality and reusability of ontologies. They provide a structured approach to addressing common modeling challenges in the development of knowledge graphs and other semantic applications.
