# kastle-drawbridge
* kastle-drawbridge is the formulation of a "zero-to-hero" curriculum for learning and using knowledge graphs. It assumes no code experience, and runs you through being able to develop a knowledge graph, and query against it.  

## Foundation
* The purpose of this directory is to familiarize a student to the field of Computer Science and the aspects of programming.  This directory will walk a student through how to use Python as a programming language.
    * This entails Data Structures, that is creating and understanding dictionaries and lists through examples illustrating their usage for storing and retrieving information.
    * Also, I/O manipulation with practical examples while also creating, navigating and manipulating directories.

## Knowledge-Graphs
* The purpose of this directory contains details on how to create, utilize, and apply a knowledge graph.  This directory inherits information from [kastle-lab\cs7810-intro-to-ke](https://github.com/kastle-lab/cs7810-intro-to-ke/) and [The KGC Open KG Curriculum](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum)
* Since the student is expected to be familiar with the foundations mentioned above, the next step would be to advance the learning with the [`RDFLib starter code`](https://github.com/kastle-lab/kastle-drawbridge/blob/master/resources/rdflib-starter.py) as a first exposure to creating KGs.
* This directory will also guide a student to understanding the concept of a turtle (`"ttl"`) file, introducing examples to navigate and validate a knowledge graph in this format.
* The final deliverable for this KG will be a student implementation of a `Family-Tree` knowledge graph as described in the [`family-tree.md`](https://github.com/kastle-lab/kastle-drawbridge/blob/master/knowledge-graphs/family-tree/family-tree.md)
