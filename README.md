# kastle-drawbridge
* kastle-drawbridge is the formulation of a "zero-to-hero" curriculum for learning and using knowledge graphs. It assumes no code experience, and runs you through being able to develop a knowledge graph, and query against it.  

## Foundation
* The purpose of this directory is to familiarize a student to the field of Computer Science and the aspects of programming.  This directory will walk a student through how to use Python as a programming language.
    * This entails Data Structures, that is creating and understanding dictionaries and lists through examples illustrating their usage for storing and retrieving information.
    * Also, I/O manipulation with practical examples while also creating, navigating and manipulating directories.

## Knowledge-Graphs
* The purpose of this directory contains details on how to create, utilize, and apply a knowledge graph.  This directory inherits information from [kastle-lab\cs7810-intro-to-ke](https://github.com/kastle-lab/cs7810-intro-to-ke/) and [The KGC Open KG Curriculum](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum)
* Since the student is expected to become familiar with the foundations mentioned above, the next step would be to get familiar with an RDFLib starter code provided in the CS7810 curriculum as a first exposure to creation og KGs.
* Following, the concept of a turtle "ttl" file will be introduced through examples with the student getting a sense on how to break that file down for future nagivation and validation of a KG.
