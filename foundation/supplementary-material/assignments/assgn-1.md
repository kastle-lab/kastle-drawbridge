# Working with Input Data

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to prompt the user for input data
- Learn how to use the user’s input data for useful calculations

## Overview

You are preparing to paint the floor in your basement with a waterproofing coating. The floor itself is
rectangular. On the floor is a circular water heater and a rectangular furnace. The area of the floor that is
taken up by the water heater and furnace cannot be painted. The tools you own allow you to measure the
floor length and width in feet, the furnace length and width in inches, and the water heater’s circumference
in inches.

You must write a program where the user can input the floor’s length and width in feet, the furnace’s length
and width in inches, the water heater’s circumference in inches, and calculate the paintable area of the floor
in square feet displayed with 3 decimal places. The paintable area of the floor is the area of the floor that is
not covered by the water heater and the furnace.

## The Program

This program will require converting inches to feet, calculating the area of circles and rectangles, accepting
user input, and properly displaying the results to the user. An example of a valid execution of the program is
shown below:

```Enter floor length (feet): 27.5
Enter floor width (feet) : 22.9
Enter the furnace length (inches): 42
Enter the furnace width (inches): 23
Enter the water heater circumference (inches): 75
Paintable floor area (square feet): 619.933
```

## Successful Task Completion Entails

- All user input values accepted
- Calculated the paintable area
- Displayed the paintable area with 3 decimal places
