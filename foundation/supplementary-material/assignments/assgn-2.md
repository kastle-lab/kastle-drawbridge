# If-else and Calculations

## Learning Objectives

Learn how to prompt the user for input data

- Learn how to use if-else statements
- Learn how to use the user’s input data for useful calculations

## Overview

Write a program that requests 5 grades from the user, computes the average grade, then tells the user their
average and corresponding letter grade. You can assume the user will always enter grades between 0.00 to
100.00.

To display the user’s grade, use the following grading scale:

```
- A: average grade >= 90.00
- B: 90.00 > average grade >= 80.00
- C: 80.00 > average grade >= 70.00
- D: 70.00 > average grade >= 60.00
- F: 60.00 > average grade
```

## The Program

This program will require accepting user input, totaling up those user inputs, averaging them, and using if,
else if, or else statements to display the grade properly. You are not required to use any loops in this
program. An example execution of the program is below:

```
Welcome to the grade estimator.
Please enter your grade for assignment 1: 90.00
Please enter your grade for assignment 2: 72.55
Please enter your grade for assignment 3: 95.82
Please enter your grade for assignment 4: 40.10
Please enter your grade for assignment 5: 89.99
Your average grade is 77.69.
You will get a C in this class.
```

## Task

- Successfully accepted all user input values
- Successfully displayed average grade
- Successfully displayed the proper letter grade for the class
